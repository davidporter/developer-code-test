# Use CMA’s Open Access API to extract a “highlight” artwork based on criteria 
# (e.g. biggest, smallest, oldest, longest artist first name, etc.) 
# from a CMA exhibition of your choosing (current or past) that 
# has at least 8 CMA-owned works (CMA exhibitions often have many works on loan. 
# The API response will only show CMA-owned works. 
# You may have to look at a few exhibitions to find one with more than 8 works!).
